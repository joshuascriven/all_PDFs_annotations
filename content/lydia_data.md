### lydia data -+- Highlights

 * Page 1: "Lydia is a system for online text analysis currently focusing on news, blogs and Medline abstracts. The goal of the project is to build a relational model of people, places, and things through natural language processing of the input text and the statistical analysis of entity frequencies and juxtapositions."

 * Page 1: "As of the time of writing, we could not find any other ongoing research on comparative analysis of sentiments scores in different languages."

 * Page 2: "Figure 1 shows an example of sentiment index comparison of the entity ``Korea'' across five languages over a period of 13 days. Our sentiment analysis component of the Lydia system [1] calculates positive or negative sentiment score for each occurrence of an entity in an article and accumulates the results on daily runs. These scores when normalized to the number of occurrences for their corresponding languages reveal interesting facts. As seen from Figure 1, the overall sentiment of Korea appears to be high in Korean language newspapers as compared to others."

 * Page 3: "The basic concept is to determine for each given day for each coreference set how much higher its popularity turns out to be above that coreference set's historical mean. We can also get a standard deviation by observing this particular coreference set's historical pattern of references to see how much fluctuation is normal for this coreference set. With these two pieces of information, we can determine how many standard deviations the actual number of references is above the mean. If this positive offset is above a certain threshold, we consider that the beginning of a spike, and thus a news storm, and track how long this trend lasts."

 * Page 4: "Figure 2 lets you see the number-of-references values that went into determining both the existence of the spike and its relative score, including the mean and threshold, along with the actual and expected values for each day. The purple region represents the detected news storm. The most significant keywords for the spike relative to before the spike were: ``extension'', ``rejects'', ``senate'', ``medicare'', and ``deadline''. From these keyword scores, the title ``Senate Rejects Medicare Deadline Extension'' was chosen from the pool of six in-spike article titles as the most representative title for the news storm."
